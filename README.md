## What is this conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture is very simple: `repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.`
The arithmetic operations are:
`f(n) = n/2 if n is even, 3*n + 1 if n is odd`

## Program
With the main function of this program you can create multiple graphs showing the values of n in the y axis and the number of operations in the x axis.

## Requirements
- python 3.x
- matplotlib
